# Correlation Framework for GHG Emissions quantification

Challenges:

+ Quantify impact of lockdown on
  + PA
  + Net zero emission target
+ Establish what specifically leads to emission reduction

What does this mean concretely? We need an estimate by country and by sector of the 
change in emissions due to lockdown.

+ This means estimates of what would have happened in 2020 without cocoV
+ Find datasets:
  + which have granular data for lockdown
  + which give long term trends and evolutions
  + existing predictions of emissions (AR5) *we haven't done this*

## Correlation framework

Unfortunately precise emission data per sector during lockdown is not available.
However numerous indicators of sectoral performance exist:

+ GDP,  
+ Stock markets,
+ energy consumption, 
+ traffic data,
+ mobility data
+ employment
+ World Bank development indicators

These sectoral performance indicators:

1. Are modelled as if cocoV didn't happen
2. are correlated to past GHG emissions
3. Through this correlation the gap between actual and modelled indicator
in 2020 gives an estimate of the change in emissions due to that sector.
4. This change of emissions can be compared to stock market performance to get
a [MtCO2/$GDP]

This is very general, a lot of data is required.

## Case study 

*Estimate of the change in GHG emissions for the UK energy sector due to lockdown*

+ Uses daily energy data from gridwatch
+ Correlated to GHG emissions of the UK Energy industry in the years 2013-2017
+ Energy demand is modelled using ...

### Modelling energy demand without lockdown

#### Seasonality model

#### Predicting Energy demand for the rest of 2020

#### Predicted change in energy demand

### Correlation on past data
