Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","As of December 2019, CAIT Historical Emission data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 185 countries and the European Union (EU) for the period 1990-2016, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks. See http://cait.wri.org/docs/CAIT2.0_CountryGHG_Methods.pdf for details regarding data source and methodology."

historical_emissions_pik,"Description: 
Recap data name, source organization
Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","The PRIMAP-hist dataset combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of greenhouse gas emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas covering the years 1850 to 2017, and all UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member states, as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The scenario in which country reported data (CRF, BUR, UNFCCC) is prioritized over third party data (CDIAC, FAO, Andrew, EDGAR, BP) is used on Climate Watch. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Due to data availability and methodological issues, version 2.1 of the PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF)."

The definition format of data for emissions/removals from the forestry sector is different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Note 3: Some non-Annex I Parties submitted their GHG inventory data using the format of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in reporting GHG emissions/removals. For this reason, these data could not be included in the data interface. However, the data are available in the national communications (Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Ghana, Jamaica, Kiribati, Mauritania, Namibia, Samoa, Suriname and Swaziland) and biennial update reports (Andorra, Armenia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mauritania, Montenegro, Namibia, Serbia, South Africa and Tunisia).

The publication of Party submissions on this website does not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the UNFCCC or the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries as may be referred to in any of the submissions.
