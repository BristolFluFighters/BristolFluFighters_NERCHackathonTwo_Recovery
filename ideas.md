# Ideas for completing the hackathon

*What are the positive and negative aspects of lockdown and recovery measures on meeting Paris and net zero targets?*

* **Q** - What are the "Paris targets"?
* **A** - The [Paris Agreement](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en) is the first ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, adopted a the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015.
* **A** - Keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
* **A** - To aim to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change.
* **Q** - What are the "net-zero targets"?
* **A** - In June 2019, the [UK Parliment passed legislation](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/net-zero-target) requiring the government to reduce the UK's net emissions of greenhouse gases by 100% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.

## Tasks

- [ ] Obtain data for UK greenhouse gas emissions, [historical](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/9568363e-57e5-4c33-9e00-31dc528fcc5a/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics) and present.
- [ ] If no up to date data for UK greenhouse gas emissions then derive UK greenhouse gas emissions from other available data sets. The Sentinel satellite data could be a good resource for this.
- [ ] Fit a model to the model to make predictions about the trajectory before and after Covid-19.
