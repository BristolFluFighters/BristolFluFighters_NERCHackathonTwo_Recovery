# Ideas for completing the hackathon

*What are the positive and negative aspects of lockdown and recovery measures on meeting Paris and net zero targets?*

* **Q** - What are the "Paris targets"?
* **A** - The [Paris Agreement](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en) is the first ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, adopted a the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015.
* **A** - Keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
* **A** - To aim to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change.
* **A** - [Carbon Brief quotes/stats](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-set-to-cause-largest-ever-annual-fall-in-co2-emissions)
  * Global emissions would need to fall by some 7.6% every year this decade – nearly 2,800MtCO2 in 2020 – in order to limit warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.
  * Global emissions in 2030 needed to be 45% below 2010 levels, in order to limit warming to 1.5C.
  * The structure of the global economy could continue its slow shift towards lower emissions per unit of GDP – in which case economic output would need to fall by 5% per year. Or GDP could continue to rise if accompanied by rapid and structural shifts towards lower-carbon economies.
  * Even the less stringent 2C limit would require sustained, annual cuts in global emissions of 2.7%, according to UNEP’s gap report, a level equivalent to around 1,000MtCO2 in 2020.
* **Q** - What are the "net-zero targets"?
* **A** - In June 2019, the [UK Parliment passed legislation](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/net-zero-target) requiring the government to reduce the UK's net emissions of greenhouse gases by 100% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.

* **Q** - What lockdown and recovery methods have been imposed and when?
* **A** - There is a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom) dedicated to the Covid timeline in the U.K. 
* **Q** - How have the lockdown measurements affected the GHG emissions in the UK (or any country)?
* **A** - We need to pick out the key policy decisions from the previous reference and correlate that with any observed changes in the levels of GHG emissions. Splitting the GHG emissions by sector (industry, transport, aviation, etc.) will allow us to dig deeper into the details.


## Tasks

- [ ] Decide which greenhouse gases we want to focus our study on.
- [ ] Obtain data for UK greenhouse gas emissions, [historical](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/9568363e-57e5-4c33-9e00-31dc528fcc5a/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics) and present.
- [ ] If no up to date data for UK greenhouse gas emissions then derive UK greenhouse gas emissions from other available data sets. The Sentinel satellite data could be a good resource for this.
- [ ] Fit a model to the model to make predictions about the trajectory before and after Covid-19.
- [ ] Set up a latex doc to put the results together
