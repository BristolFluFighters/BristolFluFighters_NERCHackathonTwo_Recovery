# Notes of UK Green House Gase Emissions

According to the [2018 UK GHG Final Figures](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/862887/2018_Final_greenhouse_gas_emissions_statistical_release.pdf) from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, UK Green House Gases (GHG) are accounted for on a *territorial basis*, that is, they only account for emissions which are generated on UK soil. This precludes emissions from maritime shipping and international aviation, as well as emissions generated by UK businesses abroad.

To further complicate the issue, there are actually [three different official metrics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24) for calculating UK emissions:

1. **Territorial Basis/DBEIS** - Only includes emissions which occur within UK borders (as above). 
2. **Residential Basis/ONS** - Represents emissions caused by UK residents and businesses whether in the UK or abroad, but excludes emissions within the UK that are caused by overseas residents and businesses. 
3. **Consumption Basis/DEFRA** - Covers emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services by households in the UK. It includes estimates of emissions associated with each stage of the supply chain for those goods and services, regardless of where they occur, while excluding emissions occurring in the UK that are associated with the consumption of goods and services by households outside the UK. 

## What are the GHGs?

* Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
* Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)
* Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)
* Hydroflurocarbons (HFC)
* Perfluorocarbons (PFC)
* Sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)
* Nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>)
